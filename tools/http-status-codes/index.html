        { code: 100, name: 'Continue', explanation: 'The server has received the request headers and the client should send the request body. Used for large request bodies (e.g. file upload) to confirm the server will accept the request.' },
        { code: 101, name: 'Switching Protocols', explanation: 'The server is switching protocols (e.g. upgrading to WebSocket) as requested by the client via the Upgrade header.' },
        { code: 102, name: 'Processing', explanation: 'The server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. Used to prevent the client from timing out during long operations (WebDAV).' },
        { code: 103, name: 'Early Hints', explanation: 'Used to send some response headers before the final response. Allows the browser to preload resources while the server prepares the full response.' },
        { code: 200, name: 'OK', explanation: 'The request succeeded. The meaning depends on the HTTP method: GET returns the resource; HEAD returns headers only; POST returns the result of the action; PUT/PATCH return the updated resource.' },
        { code: 201, name: 'Created', explanation: 'The request succeeded and a new resource was created (e.g. after POST). The response typically includes a Location header with the URI of the new resource.' },
        { code: 202, name: 'Accepted', explanation: 'The request was accepted for processing but has not been completed yet. Used for async processing; the result may be available later via another URI or notification.' },
        { code: 203, name: 'Non-Authoritative Information', explanation: 'The request was successful but the entity-body is from a third party (e.g. a cache or proxy) rather than the origin server. Rarely used in practice.' },
        { code: 204, name: 'No Content', explanation: 'The request succeeded but there is no content to return (e.g. after a DELETE or an update that does not return a body). The client should not change its view.' },
        { code: 205, name: 'Reset Content', explanation: 'The request succeeded and the client should reset the document view (e.g. clear a form). Similar to 204 but implies the client should refresh the UI.' },
        { code: 206, name: 'Partial Content', explanation: 'The server is delivering only part of the resource (byte range) as requested by the Range header. Used for resumable downloads or streaming.' },
        { code: 207, name: 'Multi-Status', explanation: 'The response body contains XML with multiple status codes for different sub-requests (WebDAV).' },
        { code: 208, name: 'Already Reported', explanation: 'Used inside a 207 Multi-Status response to avoid repeating the same internal members (WebDAV).' },
        { code: 226, name: 'IM Used', explanation: 'The server has fulfilled a GET request and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.' },
        { code: 300, name: 'Multiple Choices', explanation: 'The request has more than one possible response. The client or user agent should choose one (e.g. by following a link in the response). Rarely used.' },
        { code: 301, name: 'Moved Permanently', explanation: 'The resource has permanently moved to a new URI. Future requests should use the new URI. Search engines typically transfer SEO value to the new URL.' },
        { code: 302, name: 'Found', explanation: 'The resource temporarily resides at a different URI. The client should use the URI in the Location header for this request; the original URI may be used again later.' },
        { code: 303, name: 'See Other', explanation: 'The response to the request can be found at another URI using GET. Used after POST to redirect the user to a result page (prevents re-POST on refresh).' },
        { code: 304, name: 'Not Modified', explanation: 'Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers (e.g. If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since). The client can use its cached copy.' },
        { code: 305, name: 'Use Proxy', explanation: 'The requested resource must be accessed through the proxy given in the Location header. Deprecated and rarely used for security reasons.' },
        { code: 307, name: 'Temporary Redirect', explanation: 'The resource temporarily resides at another URI. Unlike 302, the request method and body must not be changed when reissuing the request.' },
        { code: 308, name: 'Permanent Redirect', explanation: 'The resource has permanently moved to another URI. The request method and body must not be changed when reissuing the request (unlike 301).' },
        { code: 400, name: 'Bad Request', explanation: 'The server cannot or will not process the request due to something considered to be a client error (e.g. malformed syntax, invalid request message).' },
        { code: 401, name: 'Unauthorized', explanation: 'Authentication is required and has not been provided or has failed. The response should include a WWW-Authenticate header indicating how to authenticate.' },
        { code: 402, name: 'Payment Required', explanation: 'Reserved for future use (e.g. digital payment systems). Some APIs use it to indicate quota or payment required.' },
        { code: 403, name: 'Forbidden', explanation: 'The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Unlike 401, the client’s identity may be known but they do not have permission.' },
        { code: 404, name: 'Not Found', explanation: 'The server did not find a current representation for the target resource. The resource may have been removed or the URI may be incorrect.' },
        { code: 405, name: 'Method Not Allowed', explanation: 'The method (e.g. GET, POST) is not allowed for the target resource. The response should include an Allow header listing allowed methods.' },
        { code: 406, name: 'Not Acceptable', explanation: 'No representation can be produced that matches the acceptable values defined in the request’s Accept headers (e.g. content type or language).' },
        { code: 407, name: 'Proxy Authentication Required', explanation: 'Similar to 401 but indicates that the client must first authenticate with the proxy (Proxy-Authenticate header).' },
        { code: 408, name: 'Request Timeout', explanation: 'The server did not receive a complete request message within the time it was prepared to wait. The client may repeat the request later.' },
        { code: 409, name: 'Conflict', explanation: 'The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource (e.g. version conflict, duplicate creation).' },
        { code: 410, name: 'Gone', explanation: 'The target resource is no longer available at the origin server and no forwarding address is known. Unlike 404, this is permanent and caches may remove the resource.' },
        { code: 411, name: 'Length Required', explanation: 'The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length header.' },
        { code: 412, name: 'Precondition Failed', explanation: 'One or more conditions given in the request headers (e.g. If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since) evaluated to false.' },
        { code: 413, name: 'Payload Too Large', explanation: 'The server is refusing to process the request because the payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.' },
        { code: 414, name: 'URI Too Long', explanation: 'The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target (URI) is longer than the server is willing to interpret.' },
        { code: 415, name: 'Unsupported Media Type', explanation: 'The server refuses the request because the payload is in a format not supported by the target resource for the method used.' },
        { code: 416, name: 'Range Not Satisfiable', explanation: 'None of the ranges in the request’s Range header overlap the current extent of the target resource.' },
        { code: 417, name: 'Expectation Failed', explanation: 'The expectation given in the request’s Expect header could not be met by the server.' },
        { code: 418, name: "I'm a Teapot", explanation: 'April Fools’ joke (RFC 2324). The server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot. Sometimes used by APIs to indicate a request is refused for a non-standard reason.' },
        { code: 421, name: 'Misdirected Request', explanation: 'The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response (e.g. wrong host in a multi-host setup).' },
        { code: 422, name: 'Unprocessable Entity', explanation: 'The request was well-formed but the server cannot process it due to semantic errors (e.g. validation failures). Common in REST APIs.' },
        { code: 423, name: 'Locked', explanation: 'The source or destination resource is locked (WebDAV).' },
        { code: 424, name: 'Failed Dependency', explanation: 'The request failed because it depended on another request that failed (WebDAV).' },
        { code: 425, name: 'Too Early', explanation: 'The server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed (replay attack). Sent when using Early Data in TLS.' },
        { code: 426, name: 'Upgrade Required', explanation: 'The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol (e.g. TLS).' },
        { code: 428, name: 'Precondition Required', explanation: 'The origin server requires the request to be conditional (e.g. If-Match) to prevent the "lost update" problem.' },
        { code: 429, name: 'Too Many Requests', explanation: 'The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting). The response may include Retry-After.' },
        { code: 431, name: 'Request Header Fields Too Large', explanation: 'The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large (e.g. cookies, auth token).' },
        { code: 451, name: 'Unavailable For Legal Reasons', explanation: 'The resource is unavailable due to legal demands (e.g. censorship, court order). The 451 refers to Fahrenheit 451.' },
        { code: 500, name: 'Internal Server Error', explanation: 'The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Generic catch-all for server-side failures.' },
        { code: 501, name: 'Not Implemented', explanation: 'The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request (e.g. method or feature not implemented).' },
        { code: 502, name: 'Bad Gateway', explanation: 'The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server.' },
        { code: 503, name: 'Service Unavailable', explanation: 'The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g. overloaded or down for maintenance). The client may retry later; Retry-After may be sent.' },
        { code: 504, name: 'Gateway Timeout', explanation: 'The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.' },
        { code: 505, name: 'HTTP Version Not Supported', explanation: 'The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.' },
        { code: 506, name: 'Variant Also Negotiates', explanation: 'The server has an internal configuration error: transparent content negotiation leads to a circular reference.' },
        { code: 507, name: 'Insufficient Storage', explanation: 'The method could not be performed because the server is unable to store the representation needed to complete the request (WebDAV).' },
        { code: 508, name: 'Loop Detected', explanation: 'The server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request (WebDAV).' },
        { code: 510, name: 'Not Extended', explanation: 'Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it (obsolete).' },
